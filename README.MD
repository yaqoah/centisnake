#  🐍 centisnake 🐍

A snake game implementation using the Piston game engine wrapper.

Centisnake is an attempt to learning the Rust language, and was used to practice some concepts in Data Parallelism and Game Design.

I started reading on reinforcement learning (Q-Learning) and genetic algorithm for the purpose of training the snake to find the fruit. Mission aborted (for now).
# Key Controls:

- W/A/S/D OR Up/Down/Left/Right: to change directions.

- Space: to play again.
